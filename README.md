# Limitless
A repository designed to fully automate the selection of hacking GUI for roblox games. If I have no script made for a particular game, you always have the options of this API loading other scripts alongside general options.

# Information

There are five possible statuses that can display on DetectCheck:

- Undetected. This means that there is no current report of a ban/kick using the script. Use wisely.
- Detected. This means that there are valid reports of people being banned/kicked using the script. Recommended to not use.
- On Update. This means that we are currently working to fix or add to the script. This often shows up alongside "Detected".
- Unknown. This means that the game you are playing on is not currently in our database and we have no clue if the general scripts will be detected or not. Proceed with EXTREME caution.
- Outdated. This means that the game has updated since the last working script release. This means that some features of the script may be unstable or detectable. Proceed with caution or wait until the next update.
